#### previous work happened in never_fund version 1 until we ran into an issue regarding react being installed twice resulting in useState and useEffect crashing the app. AS a solution 2.0 project was created, but this did not solve the problem. It turned out it was a rendering issue.

### ***Description***
#### A voting system for group buying 

#### Neve fund is a community based voting system for purchasing a product or file with a group fund. Each user will have the right to 1 vote, as well as the opportunity to present a product to be baught to the rest of the community.

### ***Technology Used***
* ReactJS
* ExpressJS
* MongoDB
  * Mongoose
* Atlas
* Heroku
* Insomnia
* Lucidchart
* GitHub
* Etherscan API



## For testing please create a user, add 1 or 2 tickets/ballots on the add tab, and check them out on your profile or in explore. If you create multiple users all ballots will be viewable from the Explore tab, but only the ones from current user will be able to be deleted in the profile tab.


### ***User Experience***
1. Landing Page: Basic explanation of the platform, about us, and account crerating prompts
2. LogIn page: User can create and log in to their account
3. Home page: Once LoggedIn users can see ongoing voting opportunities  & current fund balance
4. Profile page: user can see past votes, create a new voting opportuniy, and delete voting opportunites they suggested
5. TownHall: users can advertise their voting opportunity to entice at least 90% of the platform to vote favorably. Its a a simple message board.

### ***MVP***
As a prove of concept we will need:
- User creation
- Posting a voting opportunity, edting it and deleting it
- A place to vote

### ***Additions***
- Profile page with history of activity
- Townhall page for community communication
- Etherscan API to suggest products
- Metamask integration for unique users
- Smart Contract to execute group buys with group funds

### ***To Do***
- [X] ERD: Entity relationship diagram
- [X] Component hierachy diagram
- [X] Trello board
- [] Heroku Deployment
